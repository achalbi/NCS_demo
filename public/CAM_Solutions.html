	  <h2 class="style1">CAM SOLUTIONS</h2>
		<p class="para1">CAM (Computer-Aided Manufacturing) is a foremost front-end engineering solution that requires on time factor and accurate processing in any PCB Company. CAM services has been designed to help consistently accomplish the customers while gaining cost savings. NCS offers the CAM Services like RFQ, Pre-CAM/Product engineering, Front-end Engineering, Penalization, NC Drill Programming/Rout Programming, E-testing, AOI (Automatic optical Inspection), Data input is strived to produce the highest quality machined components in the safest, most efficient manner possible while still ensuring on time delivery of your products or services. </p>
		<p class="para1">  <span class= "style1_sub"> Requests for Quotation </span><br>
        A request for quotation (RFQ) is a standard business process whose purpose is to invite suppliers into a bidding process to bid on specific products or services. RFQ generally means the same thing as IFB (Invitation for Bid). Within the customer requirements, production capacity and the form factors, NCS provides the best quotation through technical reviews in terms of significant analysis and the time factor in order to ensure the customer to responds to RFQ’s faster and more accurately.
        </p>
        <p class="para1"> <span class= "style1_sub">  Pre-CAM (Product Engineering) </span>
        <br>
        Activity generally includes the following; however, this can be customized to each customer's requirements:
<ul >
<li style="color: #555555;">Read or input customer supplied electronic data (Gerber files, drawings, etc.) in any recognized format.</li>
<li style="color: #555555;">Align all layers.</li>
<li style="color: #555555;">Re-name layers as per pre-determined naming conventions.</li>
<li style="color: #555555;">Assign layer attributes.</li>
<li style="color: #555555;">Drawn to flash pad conversions.</li>
<li style="color: #555555;">Contour drawn or filled areas.</li>
<li style="color: #555555;">Assign feature attributes.</li>
<li style="color: #555555;">Perform any other customer specific operations.</li>
<li style="color: #555555;">Prepare any other customer specific reports.</li>
<li style="color: #555555;">Output data in ODB ++, or any other customer specific format.</li>
</ul>

        Cam editing :
Is the process of modifying the elements rather than reprogramming the whole thing or rvice. We at NCS are very changeling towards the editing of cam services using the standard operating procedures followed with the CAM software’s to ensure with the zero defects towards the services and thereby providing the best effective possible solutions throughout the service lifecycle at the later stages of the sales cycles.
        </p>
         <p class="para1">
       Drill:
Holes through a PCB are typically drilled with small-diameter drill bits made of solid coated tungsten carbide. Coated tungsten carbide is recommended since many board materials are very abrasive and drilling must be high RPM and high feed to be cost effective.NCS delivers the drill services in a cost-effective and efficient manner by taking the considerations of flex semi-flex and star-flex boards.
        </p>
         <p class="para1">
        DFM:
The purpose of designing a part for manufacturing is to improve the product along three dimensions such as quality, delivery, and cost.NCS Utilizes sound DFM practices will ensure quality, reduce delivery lead-times and provide a reduction in the product cost by carefully selecting the best component for your application.
        </p>
         <p class="para1">
       Mask:
Mask is a nonconducting material poured on the top and bottom layers expect on pads. NCS offers the best mask service at post cam process in order to make your product secure free from errors and thereby ensuring the customers with optimistic turn-time and quality boards.
        </p>
          <p class="para1">
      Silk:
Silk is text present on external layers to indicate the components. In simpler words, they are just acts as labels. NCS delivers the silk services through technical analysis in order to get the component value or name or version with error free solutions.
        </p>
         <p class="para1">  <span class= "style1_sub"> Penalization (Single & Multiple PCB Penalization)</span><br>
         Penalization is a procedure used to handle PCBs which would otherwise be too small to process. In short notation, penalization is the process of making a layout of the PCBs on a panel. NCS provides the best solution using the standard operating procedure with the automatic technology for Single as well as Multiple PCB’s by taking the considerations of customer’s specification, time frame and the cost effective manner.
         </p>
          <p class="para1">  <span class= "style1_sub"> NC Drill/Rout Programming (output)</span><br>
          In NCS, no matter of the complexity of the project NC drill file can be created. For this purpose the fabrication drawing is used. The NC drill file is needed to run various checks. It is very important step of the production of the board. Also at the end the routing program is created so that the routing machine can rout the boards on individual pieces or arrays. All of this is in accordance to customer fabrication drawings with no comprising on time-frame and best quality.
          </p>
           <p class="para1">  <span class= "style1_sub"> E-Testing (Electrical Testing)</span><br>
           E-testing is primarily used to detect bad plated holes, as this is the most common failure as it's more process-sensitive. In simpler words, used to ensure the customer specifications are met. Typically NCS delivers the best e-testing through checklist procedures and provides the cost effective solutions represents an optimized percentage of the overall finished board cost which can yield a large payback.
           </p>
            <p class="para1">AOI (Automatic Optical Inspection):
Automated optical inspection (AOI) is an automated visual inspection of a wide range of products, such as printed circuit boards (PCBs), LCDs, transistors, automotive parts, lids and labels on product packages or agricultural products (seed corn or fruits). In NCS, analysis of problems in the solder and assembly area of a PCB can be seen early in the production process and information used to feedback quickly to previous stages, avoiding the production of too many boards with the same problem. We can provide the customized services for the needs of axis control to enable the cooperation of mechanism and control to achieve the best performance.</p>
<p class="para1">Data Input-Extra Service in CAM:
Data input is the process of getting it right at the design stage can make all the difference between a product meeting expectations and failing to live up to the expectations of functionality or performance. This does not mean that the product is faulty –given that acceptance or reject criteria cannot be established without standards on which to base those criteria. In NCS, however setting the expectations is only one part of what we do. We see PCB design input not only as defining what we need, but also what we do with your design from receipt of data through to the finished product.</p>
